# Lab 001 â€” App (NestJS)

The implementation that used to live in `labs/001-cqrs-es/app/node` now lives in a dedicated repository so this monorepo can stay focused on architecture exercises.

- CQRS Ordering Service repository: https://github.com/JeffSkynird/cqrs-ordering-service

Clone that project to find the full NestJS CQRS + Event Sourcing service (SQLite projections, outbox dispatcher, Prometheus `/metrics`, k6 load tests, Docker setup, etc.).
